# List sorting website

## How to use it
* Choose the sorting speed (it CAN be changed while running).
* Choose the list size (it CAN'T be changed while running).
* Choose the algorithm to sort the list (it CAN'T be changed while running).

## What can you do
* Choose the sorting speed (it CAN be changed while running).
* Choose the list size (it CAN'T be changed while running).
* Choose the algorithm to sort the list (it CAN'T be changed while running).
* Generate a new list with the current size (it CAN'T be changed while running).

## Algorithms
### Working
* Selection sort (time complexity: O(n2))
* Bubble sort (time complexity: O(n2))
* Insertion sort (time complexity: O(n2))

## Note
* This website is in the starting phase, it does NOT work properly. Some things are not made and sometimes the website is not responding correctly.
